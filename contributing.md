This isn't an ivory tower and we would love all the help we can get! 

**Please don't be shy**. If you are having problems or just have a question, please open an issue. Error messages and stack traces would be most helpful. :smile:

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged, even if you don't have everything figured out. We can 
chat and come up with the best way to get it finished. Direct your pull requests to the `develop` branch. 
Don't forget to check out our [readme](README.md) for more information on how to build and test.
